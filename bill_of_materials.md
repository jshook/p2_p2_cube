# P2 P2 Cube Materials


## The P2 P2 Frame

The P2 P2 Cube frame design is effectively complete. You can safely build it without fear of much changing in the printable models. However, it does take a few tools. In order to build the P2 P2 Cube, you'll need access to the following:

### Tools

- A 3D printer which can print dimensionally accurate parts. (You can dial this in for any reasonablly capable 3d printer), with a bed size of 150mm or larger, which can print 45 degree overhangs without supports (nearly all can).
- A small precision philips screwdriver. A kit of small precision screwdrivers with a few sizes is recommended. Some of the screws on this project are very small.

### Materials

- [1x This screw kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GKXMSVR) specifically. It is important not to deviate from the screws specified in the assembly instructions because of the tolerances on the Led panel PCBs.
- [16x 6mm magnets](https://www.amazon.com/Multi-use-Refrigerator-Projects-Education-Magnetism/dp/B07D2F5XNN/) that are less than 2.7 mm thick.
- [Thin CA glue with applicator tips](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C32ME6G/) - *NOT* gel or the kind that globs! You want the kind of glue that will soak into tiny spaces.
 
## The P2 P2 Wiring (prototype version)

The initial iteration of the P2 P2 cube will use off the shelf parts which will barely fit within the interior of the frame. A subsequent version of this project will likely use a dedicated PCB which is much more targeted to the P2 P2 Cube as an integrated project.

This bill of materials captures only the current prototype build. This is for early adopters who are willing to invest the parts and time into helping with designing the next design.

To drive the P2 P2 panels, you'll need:

- A [P2-ES board](https://www.parallax.com/product/propeller-2-evaluation-board-rev-c/) from Parallax.
- A [P2-Eval Hub75 Adapter Board](https://www.parallax.com/product/p2-eval-hub75-adapter-board/)
- (1 or 2?) [LiPo Batteries](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L687XCX/) of the "Shorty" variety and a suitable LiPo charger.
- A set of 6 panels from Parallax.
- (1 or 2?) [5v step-down regulators](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08Q3LZBZH/). 
- 2 [XT60 connectors](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FAPYXS/) -- Appropriate wiring kit to assemble the lipo batteries to the 5v regulators, and regulators to the panels and P2-ES. Initially, this is XT60 as specified above with the banana plugs that come with the lipo batteries.

### Wiring it all up
