# P2 P2 Cube Materials


## The P2 P2 Frame

In order to build the P2 P2 Cube, you'll need access to the following:

### Tools

- A 3D printer which can print dimensionally accurate parts. (You can dial this in for any reasonablly capable 3d printer), with a bed size of 150mm or larger, which can print 45 degree overhangs without supports (nearly all can).
- A small precision philips screwdriver. A kit of small precision screwdrivers with a few sizes is recommended. Some of the screws on this project are very small.

### Materials

- [This screw kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GKXMSVR)
- [Some 6mm magnets](https://www.amazon.com/Multi-use-Refrigerator-Projects-Education-Magnetism/dp/B07D2F5XNN/) that are less than 2.7 mm thick.
- [Thin CA glue](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C32ME6G/) - *NOT* gel or the kind that globs! You want the kind of glue that will soak into tiny spaces.
 
## The P2 P2 Wiring (prototype version)

The initial iteration of the P2 P2 cube will use off the shelf parts which will barely fit within the interior of the frame. A subsequent version of this project will likely use a dedicated PCB which is much more targeted to the P2 P2 Cube as an integrated project.

To drive the P2 P2 panels, you'll need:

- A [P2-ES board](https://www.parallax.com/product/propeller-2-evaluation-board-rev-c/) from Parallax.
- A [P2-Eval Hub75 Adapter Board](https://www.parallax.com/product/p2-eval-hub75-adapter-board/)
- (1 or 2?)[LiPo Batteries](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L687XCX/) of the "Shorty" variety and a suitable LiPo charger.
- A set of 6 panels from Parallax.

TBD .. This part will be filled out after more electrical testing.
