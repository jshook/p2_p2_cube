# P2 P2 Cube

This is the project page of the _P2 P2 Cube_. This is a cube which is covered in P2 Led Panels, powered by a P2 processor. The first P2 represents the pixel pitch of the LEDs on the panel. The second is shorthand for the [Parallax Propeller 2 Processor](https://www.parallax.com/propeller-2/), thus _P2 P2 Cube_.

Interesting features of the P2 P2 Cube include:
- It is fully self-contained. The first version is battery powered.  
- The frame is targeted for common 3d printers, with all models carefully designed so that rafts or support structures are *NOT* needed.
- The design is based around specific panels and drivers which work with the 3d models in a seamless way. The P2 LED panels can be sourced from Parallax.

The initial version of this project is targeted at the prototype. A second iteration of the design will likely include an all-in-one PCB provided by Parallax.

## Motivation

This project has two main goals:
1) Build an awesome blinky lights cube that is fun to program and play with.
2) Showcase how awesome the Propeller 2 processor is in a very tangible and interactive way.  

## Community

- This project powered by the Propeller 2 early adopter community on the Parallax Propeller 2 message forums.
- The LED panel drivers are provided by Stephen Morocco of IronSheep productions, which also provides the HUB75 adapter board.

## Project Layout

This project is organized to help you build the P2 P2 Cube yourself, or to give you good starting points for experimenting with your own design:

- [Bill of Materials](bill_of_materials.md)
- [3d models](3d_models/README.md)
- [Frame Assembly](3d_models/assembly.md)
- Programming the P2 (TBD)
